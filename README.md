<!------------------------- GETTING STARTED ------------------------->

<h2 align="center"><b>Setup With Docker</b></h2>
Easy setup with docker-compose

1. Create a folder for Nezuko with a `config` and `logs` directory inside of it. 
2. Inside the `config` directory make a `config.json` file with the following content. Changing ownerID, prefix and token accordingly. `exceptUsers` are the user ID's of members who bypass permission checks for commands.

```json
{
  "ownerID": "YOUR DISCORD USER ID",
  "prefix": "//",
  "token": "YOUR BOT TOKEN",
  "exemptUsers": []
}

```

3. Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content. Changing the host directories if opting to store the config and log directories elsewhere.

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  nezuko:
    image: callmekory/nezuko:latest
    container_name: nezuko
    volumes:
      # where config.json, rclone.conf and db are stored
      - ./config:/app/dist/config
      # path for logs
      - ./logs:/app/logs
    restart: unless-stopped
```

4. Run `docker-compose up` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file. If all goes well you should see the bot login and present you with a invite link to add her to your server. Press `ctrl + c` to exit then run it with `docker-compose up -d` to start the bot in the background.

<h2 align="center"><b>Setup Without Docker</b></h2>

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

1. Download latest release

```sh
https://github.com/callmekory/nezuko/releases
```

2. Unzip nezuko.zip

3. Navigate into nezuko folder

4. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies

5. Edit `config/config.json` with you bot token and user ID

6. Run the bot with `npm start`


<h2 align="center"><b>Usage</b></h2>

All commands in Nezuko are linked to a database where all params are set with the command `//config`. For example to see Embys config you would do `//config get emby` and to set a param like apiKey you would do `//config set emby apiKey YOURAPIKEY`. For command usages, etc run the `//help` command.
